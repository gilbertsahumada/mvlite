# mvlite

Lightweight Move VM for local development. An anvil-like experience for Movement L1.

## What is this?

mvlite embeds the AptosVM directly as a Rust library -- no consensus, no P2P networking, no full node. It exposes an Aptos-compatible REST API so existing tools (movehat, @aptos-labs/ts-sdk) can talk to it without modification.

```
Your tests (TypeScript)
    |
    | HTTP (same REST API as a real node)
    |
    v
mvlite (this binary)
    |
    | direct, in-memory
    |
    v
AptosVM (Move VM)
```

## Why?

Movement's local node (`movement node run-localnet`) takes ~15 seconds to boot. mvlite boots in <1 second because it skips consensus, P2P, mempool, and all the infrastructure a real validator needs. For local development and testing, you don't need any of that.

| | Movement node | mvlite |
|---|---|---|
| Boot time | ~15s | <1s |
| Consensus | Full BFT | None (single-process) |
| State | Disk (RocksDB) | In-memory + JSON delta |
| Mining | Block interval | Instant |
| Network | P2P + mempool | None |

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.93+ (`rustup update stable`)
- Git

### Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gilbertsahumada/mvlite.git
cd mvlite
./build.sh
```

The build script clones `aptos-core` (pinned to the last Apache 2.0 commit) and compiles mvlite as a workspace member. First build takes ~10-15 minutes; subsequent builds are fast (~3s).

### Run

```bash
# Start with clean genesis (no network connection needed)
./target/mvlite start --port 8090

# Or fork from a remote network
./target/mvlite start --port 8090 --fork-url https://testnet.movementnetwork.xyz/v1
```

### Test

```bash
# Fund an account
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8090/mint?address=0x42&amount=1000000000"

# Query account
curl http://localhost:8090/v1/accounts/0x1

# View function
curl -X POST http://localhost:8090/v1/view \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"function":"0x1::coin::balance","type_arguments":["0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin"],"arguments":["0x42"]}'
```

## REST API

mvlite implements a subset of the [Aptos REST API](https://aptos.dev/en/build/apis/fullnode-rest-api):

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/v1/` | GET | Ledger info (chain_id, version, etc.) | Done |
| `/v1/accounts/:address` | GET | Account data (sequence number, auth key) | Done |
| `/v1/accounts/:address/resources` | GET | All account resources | Done |
| `/v1/accounts/:address/resource/:type` | GET | Specific account resource | Done |
| `/v1/view` | POST | Execute view function (BCS args) | Done |
| `/v1/transactions` | POST | Submit signed transaction (BCS body) | Done |
| `/v1/transactions/simulate` | POST | Simulate transaction without commit | Done |
| `/mint` | POST | Fund account (faucet) | Done |

## Integration with movehat

mvlite is designed to be a drop-in replacement for Movement's local node when used with [movehat](https://github.com/gilbertsahumada/movehat). Future versions of movehat will detect a running mvlite instance and use it automatically:

```typescript
// Today (with Movement node): ~15s boot
harness = await Harness.createLocal({ ... });

// Tomorrow (with mvlite): <1s boot, same API
harness = await Harness.createLocal({ ... });
```

No code changes required on the movehat side.

## How it works

mvlite uses the `aptos-transaction-simulation-session` crate from aptos-core. This crate:

1. **Creates a genesis state** with the full Aptos/Move framework (all `0x1::*` modules)
2. **Drives the AptosVM directly** -- `execute_transaction()`, `execute_view_function()`, `fund_account()`
3. **Persists state to disk** as JSON delta files (config.json + delta.json)

The HTTP server (axum) wraps the session behind a `Mutex` and translates REST requests into session method calls.
